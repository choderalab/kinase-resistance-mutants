* `abl-mutants.xlsx` - mutants gathered from the cBioPortal, Cosmic, OncoKB and literature for Abl kinase, filtered to occur within the constructs of the kinase domain 
* `mutations_with_structures` - mutations that occur within genes for which we have strucutres paired with FDA approved ligands. Structures can be found in [PDBFINDER](https://github.com/choderalab/PDBfinder)
